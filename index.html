            <p>
                Every day, more than 750,000 records are lost to data breaches 
                and hacking attempts, and the danger that they pose only continues 
                to grow as time goes on. In visualizing the magnitude in which 
                data breaches have compromised our data, we can visualize just 
                how much of an effect they can have on our day-today life.
            <p></p> 
                Here we ask ourselves, how much data has truly been compromised in the 
                past 2 decades? Who are the primary targets of data breaches? What are 
                the causes/methods employed in data breaches?

            <p>
                When looking at notable data breaches in the past two decades, we can see 
                that web-based entities are overwhelmingly the target, both in terms of 
                the number of records stolen/compromised and the number of data breaches.
                Moreover, we can see that the cause for a majority of the records being
                compromised were from external hacking attempts.
            </p><p>

                at the number of records compromised to the number of data breaches, feel free

                When looking at the specific enities that had their data compromised, it turns 
                out that Yahoo is the most insecure, losing the greatest number of records due 
                to two extremely significant hacking-based data breaches.

                When looking on previous data breaches, we can see how the causes and methods used 
                have changed throughout the years. Two trends to note are that data breaches that 
                were caused by insider agents or stolen property have become significantly less
                popular (or at the very least significantly less successful). This is signified by 
                the downwards trend in the rogue contractor/employee super-category. The other trend to
                note is that poor security has increasingly become the method by which data is being
                compromised.
            </p>
            <p>
                The significance that poor security plays into causing data breaches is only reinforced
                when looking at the methods and causes of data breaches as a whole.

            <p>
                While we still don't know the cause / methods used for a large portion of known notable
                data breaches, many of the data breaches that we do know are caused by poor security. 
                Hacking and activity by malicious agents are always still relevant, but a significant
                percentage of data breaches couldn't have happened without poor security practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Improving security practices and keeping up to date in the ways that malicious agents
                can gain access to data records can be a powerful preventative measure. By being aware 
                of the danger that data breaches can cause and what methods are used to cause them,
                we can be better prepared to prevent them from occuring in the future and protect our
                privacy.

        Data used in this visualization was the Comprehensive Data Breaches Dataset from 
        2016 to 2020. It can be found at

    <h2>Project Writeup:</h2>
    <div class = "writeup">
        <h4>Plot 1: "More Data than Ever has been Compromised by Data Breaches"</h4>
        <p>
            Choice of Color Scheme: Red was chosen for the scatter points for its contrast with the page background color 
            as well as keeping in line with the theme of escalating danger. The point of this visualization was to demonstrate 
            how the magnitude of data breaches was rising, so the color was chosen to subtly support and match that theme.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Marks and Channels: This visualization has 0 keys and 2 values. The mark is points, while the channel is the horizontal
            and vertical position of the points.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "writeup">
        <h4>Plot 2: "Web Organizations are the Most Targeted Type of Organization"</h4>
        <p>
            Choice of Color Scheme: The method super-categories were divided into red, orange, blue, brown, black, and gray. The idea
            was that each super-category would have a color that would make some amount of sense given what the super-caetgory was 
            (or at least wouldn't clash with the supercategory) while still being visually distinct from one another. The method categories
            were all variants of the same color as the super-category so that it would be somewhat clear from looking at the plot that
            some methods would be more related than others.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Marks and Channels: This visualization has 2 keys and 1 value. The mark is lines, while the channel is the horizontal
            and vertical position, and color of the points. (You could argue that length could also be a channel by considering the
            bar to be a thick line, and the length to indicate how large the value is).
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Other Design Considerations: The axis were chosen to be horizontal to help with the composition of the visualization. Having
            the data being sorted means that the longest bar is at the bottom while the shortest bar is at the top. This places points of 
            interest along the different corners of the screen and guides the audience to look at the visualization in an almost circular 
            manner, prolonging interest and overall making the visualization better to look at.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "writeup">
        <h4>Plot 3: "Yahoo is the Most Insecure Entity"</h4>
        <p>
            Choice of Color Scheme: Like the scatterplot, red was mostly chosen to keep a consistent color theming and to emphasis the
            fact that Yahoo had the most compromised data out of all the other entities in the dataset. The gray used for the other
            columns keep in theme with the grays used throughout the visualization.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Marks and Channels: This visualization has 1 key and 1 value. The mark is lines, while the channel is vertical position. 
            (You could argue that length could also be a channel by considering the bar to be a thick line, and the length to 
            indicate how large the value is). Though color plays a role in drawing interest, it doesn't technically code any information
            not already convey though the other channels, and so is not a channel.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "writeup">
        <h4>Plot 4: "Poor Security Recently Plays Bigger Role in the Cause of Data Breaches"</h4>
        <p>
            Choice of Color Scheme: Variants of Red and black were chosen because they greatly contrasted both themselves and the 
            gray background. Red was chosen for the two forms of malicous actors/actions (rogue contractor/employee and stolen/lost)
            to match with our cultural association of red, while black was chosen for poor security to contrast red and create a clear
            silhouette. The variables "hacked", "accidentally exposed", and "unknown" were marked with different variations of gray 
            since they weren't essential to the message that this visualization was trying to convey.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Marks and Channels: This visualization was the geometric visualization. The mark is areas, while the channel is also areas.
            This is because the amount of space each variable takes up is directly proportional to the value that the visualization was 
            trying to display.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "writeup">
        <h4>Plot 5: "Most Data Breaches are caused by Poor Security"</h4>
        <p>
            Choice of Color Scheme: Lke the bar graph, red was mostly chosen in this plot to maximize contrast and bring attention to 
            how large the variable "poor security" was compared to other varaibles while still keeping a consistent color theme. The other
            variables were coded as gray to emphasize the difference in magnitude between them and "poor security".
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Marks and Channels: This visualization was the boxplot visualization. The marks are lines and area, since lines denote how large
            the median and quartile values were, as well as the values of any outliers. Area is also a mark, since the larger the area, the 
            greater the variation of data there is. The channels are vertical position (or arguably length, for the reasons described above)
            and area.
