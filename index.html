            <p>
                Every day, more than 750,000 records are lost to data breaches 
                and hacking attempts, and the danger that they pose only continues 
                to grow as time goes on. In visualizing the magnitude in which 
                data breaches have compromised our data, we can visualize just 
                how much of an effect they can have on our day-today life.
            <p></p> 
                Here we ask ourselves, how much data has truly been compromised in the 
                past 2 decades? Who are the primary targets of data breaches? What are 
                the causes/methods employed in data breaches?

                When looking at notable data breaches in the past two decades, we can see 
                that web-based entities are overwhelmingly the target, both in terms of 
                the number of records stolen/compromised and the number of data breaches.
                Moreover, we can see that the cause for a majority of the records being
                compromised were from external hacking attempts.

                at the number of records compromised to the number of data breaches, feel free

                When looking at the specific enities that had their data compromised, it turns 
                out that Yahoo is the most insecure, losing the greatest number of records due 
                to two extremely significant hacking-based data breaches.

                When looking on previous data breaches, we can see how the causes and methods used 
                have changed throughout the years. Two trends to note are that data breaches that 
                were caused by insider agents or stolen property have become significantly less
                popular (or at the very least significantly less successful). This is signified by 
                the downwards trend in the rogue contractor/employee super-category. The other trend to
                note is that poor security has increasingly become the method by which data is being
                compromised.
            </p>
            <p>
                The significance that poor security plays into causing data breaches is only reinforced
                when looking at the methods and causes of data breaches as a whole.

                While we still don't know the cause / methods used for a large portion of known notable
                data breaches, many of the data breaches that we do know are caused by poor security. 
                Hacking and activity by malicious agents are always still relevant, but a significant
                percentage of data breaches couldn't have happened without poor security practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Improving security practices and keeping up to date in the ways that malicious agents
                can gain access to data records can be a powerful preventative measure. By being aware 
                of the danger that data breaches can cause and what methods are used to cause them,
                we can be better prepared to prevent them from occuring in the future and protect our
                privacy.
